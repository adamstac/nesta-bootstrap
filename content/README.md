Nesta Content Demo
==================

The files in this repository are here to provide an example of how you
can add content to your Nesta site. It's not intended as a replacement
for the documentation; more as a handy example to help get you started.

You can try viewing these pages in your local Nesta site like this:

    $ cd path/to/your-nesta-site
    $ nesta demo:content

The `nesta demo:content` command will:

 1. Clone this repository into `path/to/your-nesta-site/content-demo`.
 2. Update your `config/config.yml`, pointing Nesta to `content-demo`.
 3. Tell git to ignore the new folder (if you're using git).

Your existing content repository will remain untouched.
