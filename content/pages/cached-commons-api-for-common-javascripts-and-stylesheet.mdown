# cached-commons: API for Common Javascripts and Stylesheets Cached and Optimized

You probably already use Google's [AJAX Libraries](http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/) as a CDN for your JavaScripts. But what do you do when Google is slow to add [your favorite JavaScript library](http://www.modernizr.com/)? [Lance Pollard](http://github.com/viatropos) has created [Cached Commons](http://cachedcommons.org/), an API for common Javascripts and stylesheets, cached and optimized on GitHub's CDN.

Cached Commons lists dozens of scripts under categories like visualization, Ajax, syntax highlighting, HTML5, Flash, and testing, complete with links to project sources, demos, even documenation. Don't see a script you want? Just fork the project and your script for everyone to share.

It looks like CSS libraries are on the TODO list, just like I had asked of Google in [Episode 0.3.2](http://wynn.fm/032)!
