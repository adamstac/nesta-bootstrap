# vexflow: HTML5, Canvas, JavaScript library for music and guitar tablature

In [Episode 0.3.4](http://wynn.fm/034), Zed Shaw and I talked about the sad state of guitar tab sites, and he mentioned [VexFlow](http://www.vexflow.com) as a project to watch. VexFlow is a set of open source projects from [Mohit Muthanna](http://0xfe.blogspot.com/) that use HTML5, `<canvas>`, and SVG to render embeddable guitar tabs and music in blog posts or web pages.

#### VexTab

Instead of using the ubiquitous (yet extremely free-form) ASCII tabs with which most guitarists are familiar, VexFlow introduces its own tablature and music markup language:

> VexTab is a language that allows you to easily create, edit, and share guitar tablature. Unlike ASCII tab, which is designed for *readability*, VexTab is designed for *writeability*.

VexTab is easy to write

    tabstave
    notes 0/4 14/3 13/1 14/3 0/4 12/3 12/1 12/3 | 
    notes 0/4 10/3 10/1 10/3 0/4 9/3 8/1 9/3

    tabstave
    notes 0/4 5/3 5/1 5/3 0/4 4/3 3/1 4/3 |
    notes (3/1.4/3)s(1/1.2/3) 

    tabstave
    notes 0/5 0/5 3b4/5 0/4 3b4/4 0/4 |
    notes 2/3 0/1 3/2 2/3 0/1 3/2 2/3
    
This intro to [Dead or Alive](http://www.last.fm/music/Bon+Jovi/_/Wanted+Dead+or+Alive) in VexTab can be beautifully rendered into guitar tablature using [TabDiv](http://vexflow.com/tabdiv/), VexFlow's HTML5/JavaScript/`<canvas>`/SVG embedding library.

VexFlow also supports clef-based music notation as well.

    tabstave notation=true
    notes :8 [ 5s7/5 ] :q (5/2.6/3)h(7/3) [ :8 6/4 :16 7p5/5 ]

For browsers without `<canvas>` support, TabDiv supports SVG with the help of [RaphaÃ«lJS](http://wynn.fm/025) from Dmitry Baranovskiy.

You can try your hand at writing VexTab in your browser with Mohit's [awesome tutorial](http://vexflow.com/vextab/tutorial.html).
