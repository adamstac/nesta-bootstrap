# Puppet Dashboard: A web interface w/ node management and reporting tools

The Puppet Dashboard is a Puppet web interface that provides node management and reporting tools. Nodes can be exported in YAML format, allowing the dashboard to be used as an external node classification tool.

Requires `ruby >= 1.8.1` and `sqlite3` (by default).
