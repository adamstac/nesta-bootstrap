# FuseJS aims to improve the JavaScript frameworks you already use

Hot on the heels of [FuseBox](http://thechangelog.com/post/347681293/fusebox-a-safer-way-to-monkey-patch-javascript), [John-David Dalton](http://github.com/jdalton) releases [FuseJS](http://github.com/jdalton/fusejs), a new JavaScript framework that aims to provide "one stable, efficient, and optimized core JavaScript framework." FuseJS targets common framework features including DOM manipulation, event registration, and CSS selector engines and seeks to improve your favorite JavaScript framework.

> In most cases a developer could simply replace a supported client-side framework with FuseJS + emulation layer and receive instant performance and stability gains while continuing to use the framework API they are familiar with.
