# aruba - Cucumber steps for testing your command line apps

Terminal junkies rejoice! Now you can use [Cucumber](http://cukes.info) to test your command line interfaces just like you do for your web apps. [Aruba](http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/aruba) from Cucumber creator [Aslak Helles√∏y](http://github.com/aslakhellesoy) provides familiar step definitions for testing output, exit statuses, and file system commands. Here's an example feature file for testing exit statuses:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/303804.js?file=aruba_exit.feature"></script>

Aruba provides the exit status step:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/303804.js?file=steps.rb"></script>

To use Aruba just install the gem

    sudo gem install aruba

and then require it in your `env.rb` or any file under `features/support`

    require 'aruba'
