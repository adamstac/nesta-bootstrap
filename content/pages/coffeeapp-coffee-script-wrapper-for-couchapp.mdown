# coffeeapp: Have some CoffeeScript on the CouchApp

One of the cool things about [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) is its built-in web server which lets you easily create all-in-one HTML5 and JavaScript applications that [J Chris Anderson](http://twitter.com/jchris) calls [CouchApps](http://couchapp.org/page/index).

If [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) (covered in [Episode 0.2.9](http://thechangelog.com/post/849754840/episode-0-2-9-coffeescript-with-jeremy-ashkenas)) is your preferred method to sling JavaScript these days, check out [CoffeeApp](http://github.com/andrzejsliwa/coffeeapp) from [Andrzej Sliwa](http://github.com/andrzejsliwa). CoffeeApp is a simple wrapper on top of CouchApp that lets you write your apps in Coffee as well as manage multiple releases of your apps with deployment snapshots.

Assuming you've gotten CoffeeScript installed including its Node.js dependencies, you can install CoffeeApp via the excellent [npm](http://npmjs.org).

    npm install coffeeapp

You can then invoke `coffeeapp` with the normal `couchapp` [options](http://couchapp.org/page/couchapp-usage)

    coffeeapp [options]

CoffeeApp maintains a .releases folder where your *.coffee files are converted to to *.js on-the-fly before pushing to CouchDB.

#### **UPDATE

Andrzej has made a flurry of changes yesterday including some nifty generators:

    $ coffeeapp cgenerate view myview

    CoffeeApp (v0.0.5) - simple coffee-script wrapper for CouchApp (http://couchapp.org)
    http://github.com/andrzejsliwa/coffeeapp

    Running CoffeeApp 'view' generator...
     * creating myview/map.coffee...
     * creating myview/reduce.coffee...
    done.
