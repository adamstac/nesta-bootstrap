# OmniGroup Frameworks: Objective-C frameworks for Mac OSX and iOS apps

The [Omni Group](http://www.omnigroup.com/), makers of wildly popular Mac and iOS products such as [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/) and  [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/), want to share some of their code with you.

The [OmniGroup Frameworks](http://github.com/omnigroup/OmniGroup) are a set of Objective-C code libraries for both Mac and iOS that peform a wide range of common tasks.

* **OmniFoundation** includes a set of low-level objects like `OFStringScanner` for scanning Unicode strings, `OFRegularExpression` for Regex, and `OFMessageQueue` & `OFQueueProcessor` for multithreaded operations.
* **OmniDataObjects** resemble CoreData *light*, built on top of SQLite for Mac and iOS.
* **OmniAppKit** provides types like `OAOSAScript` for enabling AppleScript in your app, `OAPreferences` for multi-pane preferences windows, and `OAFindPanel` for find-and-replace tasks.
* **`OmniInspector`** is the inspector seen at work in OmniGraffle, OmniFocus, OmniOutliner and OmniPlan
* **OmniNetworking** provides higher-level types to work with TCP, UDP and Multicast networking.
