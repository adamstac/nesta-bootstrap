# scrobbyl: Automatically Scrobble your vinyl collection in real time

When we find them, we like to cover niche projects that show off the homebrew spirit that has always been strong in open source communities.

Scrobbyl is a Python utility to sample what's spinning on your turntable and _scrobble_ it to your [Last.fm](http://last.fm) account.

#### How does it work?

First, authenticate Scrobbyl with your Last.fm account:

    python lastfm.py auth

Next, make sure `ffmpeg` is in your `PATH`, hook up your turntable to your audio line in and run `scrobbyl`

    ./scrobbyl

Scrobbyl will create an audio fingerprint of your track, query it via the [Echo Nest API](http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/), and update your Last.fm account.

The term _scrobbyl_ is a mashup of [_scrobble_](http://www.last.fm/help/faq?category=Scrobbling) and _vinyl_. Be sure and catch [Episode 0.3.5](http://lg.gd/035) with [Max Howell](http://twitter.com/mxcl), formerly of Last.fm, who built the original Last.fm Scrobbler.
