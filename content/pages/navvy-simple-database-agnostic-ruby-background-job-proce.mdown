# Navvy: Simple database agnostic Ruby background job processor

If you like [delayed_job](http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job) but want to BYODB, [@jeffkreeftmeijer](http://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer) brings you Navvy. 

From the [README](http://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/navvy#readme)

> Navvy is a simple Ruby background job processor inspired by delayed_job, but aiming for database agnosticism. Currently Navvy supports ActiveRecord, MongoMapper, Sequel and DataMapper but itâ€™s extremely easy to write an adapter for your favorite ORM. Besides plain Ruby (1.8 & 1.9) it completely supports Rails Edge.

Navvy gets an endorsement from Mr. MongoMapper [@jnunemaker](http://github.com/jnunemaker) in upcoming episode 0.1.2.

We're looking forward to Monitor, the planned web UI to Navvy.
