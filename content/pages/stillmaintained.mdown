# stillmaintained: Find a maintainer for your open source projects

Source control systems like Git make it easier to maintain project momentum and avoid abandoned open source projects. Instead of waiting on project owners to make changes, project users can simply create their own forks and supply their own patches. But this creates other issues over time such as _what's the canonical repository for the project?_ Wouldn't it be better if project owners could recruit someone to take the reins and keep the project moving?

It's in that spirit that [Jeff Kreeftmeijer](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer) has created [Still Maintained?](http://stillmaintained.com/). Simply log in via [GitHub](http://github.com) OAuth and flag each of your projects as actively maintained, seeking a new owner, or abandoned.

By the way, I'm looking for someone to take over my [LinkedIn Ruby wrapper](http://github.com/pengwynn/linkedin). Apply within.
