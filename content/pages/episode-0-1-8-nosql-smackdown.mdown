# Episode 0.1.8 - NoSQL Smackdown!

While at [SXSW Interactive](http://sxsw.com/interactive), Adam and Wynn got to attend the [Data Cluster Meetup](http://datacluster.infochimps.org/) hosted by [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com) and [Infochimps](http://infochimps.com). Things got a bit rowdy when the panel debated features of Cassandra, CouchDB, MongoDB and Amazon SimpleDB and started throwing dirt at everybody else's favorite NoSQL databases.

Items mentioned in the discussion:

* [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) The Apache Cassandra Project brings together Dynamo's fully distributed design and Bigtable's ColumnFamily-based data model and powers some of the world's largest sites.
* [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) Apache,CouchDB is a distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free document-oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP/JSON API.
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) Combining the best features of document databases, key-value stores, and RDBMSes.
* [Amazon SimpleDB](http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/) a highly available, scalable, and flexible non-relational data store that offloads the work of database administration.
* [Dynamo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_(storage_system)) Dynamo is a highly available, proprietary key-value structured storage system that powers parts of Amazon Web Services.
* [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.
* [Persevere](http://www.persvr.org/) Persevere helps you rapidly develop data-driven JavaScript-based rich internet applications.
* [Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/) Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists, sets, and ordered sets.
* [Neo4j](http://neo4j.org/) Neo4j is a graph database. It is an embedded, disk-based, fully transactional Java persistence engine that stores data structured in graphs rather than in tables.
