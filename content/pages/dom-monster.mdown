# dom-monster: Cross-browser bookmarklet to analyze your DOM, improve performance

Thomas Fuchs, JavaScript pro featured recently on [Episode 0.3.9](http://lg.gd/039) has teamed up with his wife [Amy Hoy](http://slash7.com) to bring you the [DOM Monster](http://mir.aculo.us/dom-monster/), a cross-browser bookmarklet that analyzes your markup and offers tips to improve page performance.

Other tools such as [Y! Slow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/) provide similar analysis and integrate with Firebug, but the DOM Monster aims to be a cross-browser solution. Got ideas to improve the project? Check out the [project source](http://github.com/madrobby/dom-monster) and submit a patch.
