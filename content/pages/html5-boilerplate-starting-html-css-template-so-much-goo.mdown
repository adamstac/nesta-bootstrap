# html5-boilerplate: Best practices starting point project for HTML5 and mobile web apps

While HTML5 is [expanding in definition to include any whizz-bang feature in the post rounded corner web era](http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2010/aug/02/term-html5/), implementing actual HTML5 in your web app can be confusing. It's a fast moving landscape that touches everything from traditional web apps to mobile.

[Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com), the Google Chrome dev relations guy who gave us the [bulletproof syntax](http://paulirish.com/2009/bulletproof-font-face-implementation-syntax/) for [@font-face](http://thechangelog.com/tagged/typography), brings us his [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate) a great tutorial/starting point for implementing a number of best practices in your desktop and mobile web applications including

  * HTML5 `<!doctype>` and CSS reset
  * Handheld stylesheets
  * CSS media queries for advanced mobile device targeting (even portrait or landscape layouts)
  * Paul's [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/) script for detecting device capabilities such as `Modernizr.video.ogg`
  
The current version is heavily documented. Paul promises a more slim, production ready version soon.
