# Episode 0.1.0 - Chris Wanstrath from GitHub

**New point release!** Adam and Wynn talk with Chris Wanstrath aka [@defunkt](http://github.com/defunkt) from GitHub about the magic of [Git](http://git-scm.com/), the past, present and future of [GitHub](http://github.com), building a bootstrapped startup and some other cool stuff youâ€™ll just have to hear for yourself.

Stick around until the end when we announce a new feature of The Changelog that will help you keep up with the fast-moving world of open source.
