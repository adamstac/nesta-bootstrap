# gitifier: Growl alerts for any Git repo including GitHub and Gitorious

Last week we covered [GithubNotifier](http://thechangelog.com/post/1170147881/github-notifier-growl-notifications-for-github), a nifty Mac OSX menu app that monitors [GitHub](http://github.com) using the API and notifies you of updates to your repositories.

[Jakub Suder](http://github.com/psionides) has released, [Gitifier](http://github.com/psionides/gitifier) his own take on the idea, opting instead to use Git itself to do the monitoring, which has some added benefits.

#### Support for any Git repository

Since Gitifier uses the `git` command line tools directly, it can listen in to _any_ Git repository, not just the ones on GitHub but [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org/) or _private_ Git mirrors. Jakub also lets you set the path to your `git` command regardless of how you installed Git, downloaded from source or installed via a package manager like [Homebrew](http://thechangelog.com/post/1122365505/episode-0-3-5-homebrew-with-max-howell).

#### Less noise

Since you opt-in to just the repos you care about, there is less noise in your [Growl](http://growl.info) alerts. For even more signal-to-noise you have the option of ignoring your own commits (since you already know about those) as well as merge commits.
