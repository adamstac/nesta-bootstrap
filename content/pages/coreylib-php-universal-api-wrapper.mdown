# CoreyLib: PHP Universal API Wrapper

The PHP world is filled with API and XML Parsers that often bring page rendering to a crawl.

Aaron Collegeman's [CoreyLib library](http://coreylib.com/) is an incredibly simple universal API wrapper with caching built in.

It can handle most modern APIs with full XML, JSON, authentication, parameterization, xmlNode, and Xpath support. All requests can be cached in MySql and parsed at a custom interval to dramatically improve page rendering speed. It's available as a zero-config [WordPress plugin](http://github.com/kennethreitz/coreylib-wordpress-plugin) too.

Here's all the code needed to get the latest 5 tweets from twitter:
