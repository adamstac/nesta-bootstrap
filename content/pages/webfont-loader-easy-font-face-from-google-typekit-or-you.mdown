# WebFont Loader - easy @font-face from Google, TypeKit, or your own site

Thanks to greater browser support for [@font-face](http://www.font-face.com/#lime_content), web typography is breaking free from the same boring font stacks we've known for the last ten years. As with any new technique, @font-face introduces new challenges for finding the right cross-browser syntax, especially to avoid things like Firefox's [Flash of Unstyled Text](http://paulirish.com/2009/fighting-the-font-face-fout/) issue.

[WebFont Loader](http://github.com/typekit/webfontloader) is an open source project from [Typekit](http://typekit.com/) that helps you easily embed web fonts in a consistent, cross browser way regardless of the font source. It also provides some events you can handle as fonts are loaded, letting you more closely control the font rendering process.

    <script>
      WebFont.load({
        google: {
          families: ['Droid Sans']
        }
      });
    </script>
    <style>
      h1 {
        font-family: 'Droid Sans';
        visibility: hidden;
      }
      .wf-active h1 {
        visibility: visible;
      }
    </style>

In this example, we can hide the `h1` until the Droid Sans font has finished loading.

WebFont Loader is hosted on [Google AJAX APIs](https://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/docs/getting_started.html) and can use the [Google Font API](http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/) to load [fonts from Google](http://code.google.com/webfonts), from [TypeKit](http://typekit.com), or even your own custom site. Hopefully we'll see support for [FontSquirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/) and [FontSpring](http://fontspring.com) soon.
