Want to create an eBook but don't want to futz with learning new tools? [Davide Casali](http://intenseminimalism.com/), [Marco Colombo](http://www.spellmatrix.com/), and [Alessandro Morandi](http://simbul.bzaar.net/) have created [Baker](http://github.com/simbul/baker), a new framework to let you create books for the iPad using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Baker aims to do for books what [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com/) has done for HTML5 web apps in just three steps.

#### Design

Baker currently supports portrait layouts, so just design your book using a web layout 768px wide. Pages can be as tall as you want and will scroll anything over 1024px. Multiple chapters are supported using separate HTML files.

#### Package

Drop the contents of your book into a `/book` folder, naming chapters sequentially as `1.html`, `2.html`, `3.html`, etc. You may use subfolders for assets, but your chapters must be in the root folder.

#### Publish

To publish your book, you'll need an [Apple Developer account](http://developer.apple.com). Then you can publish your book using the Baker XCode project, renaming the project to reflect your book title as well supplying your own icon for the App Store.
