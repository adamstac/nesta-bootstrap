# Facebook's HipHop leaves PHPers dancing

When Twitter faced early scaling issues, much was made of decisions to rewrite large portions of the Rails site in Scala. 

Facebook however has decided to double down on PHP, releasing [HipHop](http://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php), a PHP source code transfomer:

> HipHop programmatically transforms your PHP source code into highly optimized C++ and then uses g++ to compile it. HipHop executes the source code in a semantically equivalent manner and sacrifices some rarely used features — such as eval() — in exchange for improved performance.
