# toto - Close-to-the-metal blogging on top of Rack

Take a look around the small site web landscape and it's clear we're not in Kansas anymore. It's no longer a foregone conclusion that a new blog or brochure site should be built on a CMS or even web framework. [Toto](http://github.com/cloudhead/toto) is the latest in a rising breed of static page generators.

Toto dumps the database and stores its content in plain text files. Its built on top of Rack and is [Heroku](http://heroku.com) &amp; [Varnish](http://varnish-cache.org/) friendly so that your site will scream on even a free single dyno.

From the [README](http://github.com/cloudhead/toto#readme), here's how Toto works:

* content is entirely managed through git; you get full fledged version control for free.
* articles are stored as .txt files, with embeded metadata (in yaml format).
* articles are processed through a markdown converter (rdiscount) by default.
* templating is done through ERB.
* toto is built right on top of Rack.
* toto was built to take advantage of HTTP caching.
* toto was built with heroku in mind.
* comments are handled by disqus
* individual articles can be accessed through urls such as /2009/11/21/blogging-with-toto
* the archives can be accessed by year, month or day, wih the same format as above.
* arbitrary metadata can be included in articles files, and accessed from the templates.
* summaries are generated intelligently by toto, following the :max setting you give it.
* you can also define how long your summary is, by adding ~ at the end of it (:delim).

To get started quickly, clone the default template [Dorothy](http://github.com/cloudhead/dorothy) and deploy to Heroku in a snap.
