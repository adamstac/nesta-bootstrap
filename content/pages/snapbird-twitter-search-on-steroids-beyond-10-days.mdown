# Snapbird - Twitter search on steroids

If you've ever spent time looking for a long lost tweet and have gotten frustrated by the short window that tweets are indexed by [Twitter Search](http://search.twitter.com), then check out [Snapbird](http://github.com/remy/snapbird) from [Remy Sharp](http://github.com/remy) of [jQuery for Designers](http://jqueryfordesigners.com/) fame.

Snapbird lets you search someone's timeline, favorites, or your own direct messages without the 7 day Twitter Search restriction. It even lets you [permalink favorite queries](http://snapbird.org/changelogshow/timeline/episode).

Snapbird also uses Twitterlib, [Remy's JavaScript Twitter API wrapper](http://github.com/remy/twitterlib). 

Snapbird is open source so you can either use the [hosted version](http://snapbird.org) or [fork the project](http://github.com/remy/snapbird) and run your own.
