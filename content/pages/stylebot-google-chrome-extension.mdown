# stylebot: Site-specific styles in Google Chrome

One of the things I missed moving to Google Chrome as my full time browser was Grease Monkey and site-specific hacks. Custom user stylsheets have been available in Chrome for a little while now, but they're cumbersome to manage.

[Ankit Ahuja](http://github.com/ankit) has made overriding a site's styles a snap with [Stylebot](http://github.com/ankit/stylebot), an extension for Google Chrome he built as part of [Google's Summer of Code 2010](http://socghop.appspot.com/).

To use Stylebot, just install the extension for the [Google Extensions Gallery](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha) or clone the [repo](http://github.com/ankit/stylebot) and open the `.crx` file with Chrome.

Once installed you get a handy 'CSS' link in Chromes address bar that opens the Stylebot panel, letting you select elements and override default styles. For advanced users, you can drop in your own site-specific CSS, like this:

    code, #browser table {
      font-family: menlo ;
    }

Just like that, my favorite fixed width font on [GitHub.com](http://github.com).
