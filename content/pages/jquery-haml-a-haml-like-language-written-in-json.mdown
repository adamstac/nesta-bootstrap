# jQuery-Haml: A Haml-like language written in JSON

WOW! Haml is making in-roads to JSON! [jQuery-haml](http://github.com/creationix/jquery-haml) is a [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/)-like language written in [JSON](http://www.json.org/). This allows for easy DOM building so that web apps can do more work independent of the server for a better user experience.

You can see a small example page using it at [http://static.creationix.com/jquery-haml/examples/index.html](http://static.creationix.com/jquery-haml/examples/index.html). View the source to see that all the content is built after page load.

To be clear this project was recently split. The server-side half of the component stayed at the old name of [haml-js](http://github.com/creationix/haml-js) and has it's own documentation and everything there.

Hat tip: [Us](http://thechangelog.com/) - [http://thechangelog.com/post/265338825/picard-a-micro-framekwork-for-node-js](http://thechangelog.com/post/265338825/picard-a-micro-framekwork-for-node-js)

> Similar to Sinatra and uses Haml-js. Looks like things are heating up for Node.js.
