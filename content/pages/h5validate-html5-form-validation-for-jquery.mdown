# h5Validate: HTML5 Form Validation for jQuery

h5Validate is a jQuery plugin that understands HTML5 forms and knows how to validate them, even in browsers that don't yet support HTML5.

In browsers that do support HTML5, h5Validate adds some much-needed features, such as the ability to customize the user interface when an input fails validation.

For demo and usage, [see the h5Validate homepage](http://ericleads.com/h5validate).

### Jump Start

Copy and paste this at the end of the body on any page with an HTML5 form. If html5 validation rules exist in the form, you're in business!

    <script src="lib/jquery/jquery-1.4.2.min.js"></script>
    <script src="jquery.h5validate.js"></script>

    <script>
    $(document).ready(function () {
        $('form').h5Validate();
    });
    </script>
