# SimFinger - make awesome screencasts of your mobile apps on your Mac

[SimFinger](http://github.com/atebits/SimFinger) is a screencasting tool from Loren Brichter aka [@atebits](http://twitter.com/atebits), author of popular apps like [Tweetie](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-iphone/) for the iPhone as well as the [desktop](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/). SimFinger is a Cocoa app for the Mac that adds some polish to your mobile app screencasts by providing:

* A frame that sits on top of the simulator and adds shine and an iPhone 3G look
* A halo around the pointer to indicate touch events
* Ability to set the carrier text 
* Fake apps (and dock badge counts) so that your app isn't so lonely on the home screen.

Notice that we say 'mobile apps' and not 'iPhone' or 'Touch' apps because a [fork](http://github.com/kreutz/SimFinger) from [@kreutz](http://github.com/kreutz) adds support for the PalmPre simulator.
