# git-achievements: Earn geeky merit badges while learning Git

Between Foursquare and Gowalla, it seems badges are all the rage these days. [Benjamin C. Meyer](http://http://github.com/icefox) aka [icefox](http://http://github.com/icefox), brings the fun to your terminal with [Git Achievements](http://github.com/icefox/git-achievements). The premise is simple: unlock badges as you learn and use [git](http://git-scm.com/), everyone's favorite distributed version control system. For instance, running

    git add --help

will unlock the "Student" badge. Want to become an "Investigator?" try using `git blame`. There are over forty achievements in all, and you can view them in the [project source](http://github.com/icefox/git-achievements/blob/gh-pages/git-achievements).

To install, download or clone the project and alias `git` to `git-achievements`, perhaps in your `.bash_profile`:

    export PATH="$PATH:~/git/git-achievements"
    alias git="git-achievements"

Now try it out.

    git achievements --help

Congrats, you've unlocked your first achievement!

For Ã¼ber git geek status, you can have your achievements posted to [GH Pages](http://pages.github.com/), just like [Benjamin does](http://icefox.github.com/git-achievements/).

First, fork and clone [the repository](http://github.com/icefox/git-achievements). Then configure auto uploading:

    git config --global achievement.upload "true"

Benjamin just added _Merchant Level 5_. What's next? Maybe Foursquare-style achievements like
