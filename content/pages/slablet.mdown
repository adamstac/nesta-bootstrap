# slablet: Stylish CSS layout for iPad and more

If you like [Sencha Touch](http://sencha.com), the HTML5 mobile framework we recently covered in [Episode 0.3.0](http://wynn.fm/030), but long for a more declarative, markup-driven approach, then keep an eye on [Slablet](http://github.com/fellowshiptech/slablet) from [Fellowship Technologies](http://www.fellowshiptech.com/).

Slablet, as [defined by Urban Dictionary](http://urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slablet):

  > (n.) - a slang word for a computer tablet such as the iPad or other branded tablet devices
  
Unlike Sencha's JavaScript-centric approach, Slablet opts for a more unobtrusive implementation. Content is created in HTML, styled with CSS, and driven by jQuery. The project uses [iScroll](http://cubiq.org/iscroll) to provide `overflow:scroll` in its fixed height elements.

Fellowship has provided a few nice looking [demos](http://host.sonspring.com/slablet/).

If you're wanting to start developing split-pane interfaces for the iPad, give Slablet a look.
