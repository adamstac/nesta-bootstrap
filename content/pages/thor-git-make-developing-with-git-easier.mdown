# Thor-Git: Make developing with Git easier 

Thor-Git is a set of Thor tasks to make developing with Git easier.

The tasks are designed around a particular workflow in which you primarily develop against a single upstream that you git-push or git-svn dcommit to. In this workflow master typically mirrors this upstream, and little or no work is done on master. Instead you branch off master with thor git:open and then commit as you go, using thor git:push to send your changes upstream, and finally using thor git:close to delete the branch when you’re done with it.
