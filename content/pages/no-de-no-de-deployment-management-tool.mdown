# no.de: CLI for Joyent's Node.js hosting

Joyent's [No.de](https://no.de/) sevice and its [API](https://api.no.de/) look to be an exciting option to host [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) projects. [Jeremy Johnstone](http://github.com/jsjohnst) brings that API to your CLI with his [no.de](http://github.com/jsjohnst/no.de) wrapper.

no.de can be installed via [npm](http://npmjs.org):

    npm install no.de

Next, configure your API credentials:

    $ no.de config --api pengwynn S3CR3T
    New config options for API have been saved!

Setting up a new no.de instance requires an invite, or coupon. You can check if you've got any available with the `coupons` command.

    $ no.de coupons
    You have no available coupons! Try requesting one maybe?

D'oh, no soup for us. Let's request one, maybe we'll get lucky:

    $ no.de coupons --request
    You have already requested a coupon.

I got this message because I had already requested one by showing the API some love, literally: 

    $ curl -k -u pengwynn:S3CR3T https://api.no.de/â™¥ -X POST

Oh well, if someone at Joyent is reading this, I'd love a coupon.

#### **UPDATE

Thanks so much to [konobi](http://twitter.com/konobi) for hooking me up!
