# Git User's Survey 2010

Over the past several years, with the increased popularity of open source and the advent of companies like [Github](http://github.com), [Codaset](http://codaset.com), and [Heroku](http://heroku.com), version control for code collaboration and development has really taken off.

One of the often forgotten things is that without good feedback from users, the tools that are core to the open source ecosystem today would not be able to become better and progress further. 

Sometimes it's hard to know just how to give feedback on the tools that we take for granted, however, the development community of [Git](http://git-scm.org) have taken the initiative to setup a [survey](https://www.survs.com/survey/MUPYR8UJ4B) to gather annual feedback on the project from it's users.

If you have five or ten minutes free today, why not fill out the [completely anonymous survey for Git User's](https://www.survs.com/survey/MUPYR8UJ4B) &mdash; I know I will be!
