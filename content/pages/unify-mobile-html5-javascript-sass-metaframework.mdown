# Deutsche Telekom releases Unify, metaframework for mobile built on HTML5, JavaScript, and Sass

At [JSConf.eu 2010](http://jsconf.eu/2010/), [Deutsche Telekom](http://www.telekom.de/) took the wraps off of their [Unify Project](http://unify.github.com/unify/) which aims to provide a unified API for building cross-platform mobile and desktop applications.

Unify looks to be a metaframework of sorts, wrapping other popular frameworks:

* [qooxdoo](http://qooxdoo.org/) is a comprehensive and innovative framework for creating rich internet applications (RIAs) using object-oriented JavaScript
* [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com/) provides a native wrapper for web apps, providing interfaces for device features not supported with browser-based apps alone.
* [Sass](http://www.sass-lang.com/) is a superset of CSS3 syntax and provides programmatic features for CSS such as variables, mixins, and selector nesting, covered way back in [Episode 0.0.1](http://lg.gd/001)
* [Adobe AIR](http://adobe.com/products/air) provides a cross-platform runtime for desktop applications.

Unify currently supports iOS, Android, and WebOS devices and plans to support BlackBerry OS 6.0 soon.

### [API](http://unify.github.com/unify/api/index.html#unify)

The [Unify API](http://unify.github.com/unify/api/index.html#unify) provides a single progamming model to features such as IO, storage, cache, geolocation, and even UI.

Here's the `ScrollView` class as an example:

> ##### unify.ui.mobile.ScrollView
>
* Scrolling could be enabled/disabled separately for each axis.
* Indicator style is changable through an API call (per instance)
* Flips back when scrolling out of allowed ranges.
* Smooth animations for deleleration and flip back
* Page based scrolling where the content is auto-splitted into pages which are used for snapping into

Keep an eye on the [Unify Roadmap](http://unify.github.com/unify/#roadmap) for updates and real-world implementations.
