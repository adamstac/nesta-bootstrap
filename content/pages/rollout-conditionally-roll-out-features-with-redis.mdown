# Rollout: Conditionally roll out features with Redis


Ever wanted to roll out new features in your web app to only select users, bit by bit, testing performance as you go? [James Golick](http://github.com/jamesgolick) has harnessed the power of [Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/) to do just that with  [Rollout](http://github.com/jamesgolick/rollout).

Rollout is a gem, so just install from the command line:

    gem install rollout

To get started, create your Rollout

    $redis   = Redis.new
    $rollout = Rollout.new($redis)
    
You can then activate/deactivate features in a number of ways

by group,

    $rollout.activate_group(:chat, :all)
    $rollout.deactivate_group(:chat, :all)

by user,

    $rollout.activate_user(:chat, @user)
    $rollout.deactivate_user(:chat, @user)
    
or even for a percentage of users

    $rollout.activate_percentage(:chat, 20)
    $rollout.deactivate_percentage(:chat)
    
As a failsafe, you can back out a broken feature with the nuclear option:

    $rollout.deactivate_all
