# handlebars.rb: Ruby Bindings for Handlebars.js

First there was [Mustache](http://github.com/defunkt/mustache), the nifty `{}`-based templating library from [Defunkt](http://github.com/defunkt). Then, [Jan Lehnardt](http://github.com/janl) followed up with [Mustache.js](http://github.com/janl/mustache.js/). Last month, we were excited to [cover Handlebars.js](http://thechangelog.com/post/1111122817/handlebars-js), Yehuda Katz' nifty riff on Mustache.js. 

Now, we've come full circle as [Charles Lowell](http://github.com/cowboyd) (of Ruby Racer fame, covered in Episode [0.2.3](http://thechangelog.com/post/590066537/episode-0-2-3-live-the-ruby-racer-with-charles-lowell)) has created [Handlebars.rb](http://github.com/cowboyd/handlebars.rb), Ruby bindings for Handlebars.js. 

Handlebars.rb is not a port, it binds to the _actual_ Handlebars.js code.

To use, clone Handlebars.rb into your project and pull down the required submodules with `git submodule update`. Now you can require the lib and render some templates:

    require 'handlebars'
    template = Handlebars.compile("{{say}}{{what}}")
    template.call(:say => "Hey", :what => "Yuh!") #=> "Hey Yuh!"
