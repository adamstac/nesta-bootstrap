# snoopy and sniffer: Detection scripts and bookmarklets for mobile browsers

One of the great things about being a front-end web developer is that you can always improve your craft. You can inspect the work of others by simply viewing the source for a web page to see what JavaScript libraries were used and how.

[Mark Perkins](http://allmarkedup.com/) offers a couple of projects to make the task a bit easier, especially on mobile devices.

#### [Snoopy](http://github.com/allmarkedup/snoopy)

[Snoopy](http://snoopy.allmarkedup.com/) is a bookmarklet that lets you *snoop* on pages on mobile devices like the iPad (although it works on the desktop nicely, too). Simply add the script as a bookmark, navigate to your target page, and launch the bookmarklet. Here's a [screenshot](http://cl.ly/eccbe82e3aa9d9220107/content) of Snoopy snooping on the [Modernizr web site](http://www.modernizr.com/).

#### [Sniffer](http://github.com/allmarkedup/sniffer)

Snoopy uses [Sniffer](http://github.com/allmarkedup/snoopy) under the hood, if you want to use the detection in a close-to-the-metal script form.

Sniffer will detect:

* Page info, including doctype and charset
* Popular JavaScript libraries like jQuery, jQuery UI, Prototype, Dojo, Modernizr, and more
* Popular CMS tools such as WordPress, Joomla, and MovableType
* Analytics packages from Google, Clicky, and others
* Typography toolkits like Cufon, TypeKit, sIFR, and Google's Webfonts
