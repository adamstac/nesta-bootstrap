# Stashboard - Customized status board for your services

[![Screenshot](http://www.stashboard.org/images/screenshot.png)](http://stashboard.org)

[Stashboard](http://github.com/twilio/stashboard) from [Twilio](http://twilio.com) let's you build a simple green-yellow-red status board for all APIs and services in your stack. Originally built for [Twilio's own status page](http://github.com/twilio/stashboard), Stashboard is built in Django and deploys easily to Google's App Engine.

Stashboard has a [REST API](http://stashboard.appspot.com/documentation/rest) that lets you manage services, events, and statuses. A service is an item such as a web service that you want to track in the Stashboard. Services have a list of chronological events that track status changes for the service. The current status is the status for the latest event for a service.
