# WatchWednesday for 20100929

It's [Wednesday again](http://thechangelog.com/post/1167855730/watchwednesday-20100922), time for us to serve up another quick list of projects to watch on [GitHub](http://github.com). These are projects you might have missed or should could keep an eye on.

#### [Heroku::Autoscale](http://github.com/ddollar/heroku-autoscale)

[David Dollar](http://github.com/ddollar) makes automatically scaling your [Heroku](http://heroku.com) dynos a snap with this gem. Simply add the gem to your Gemfile

    gem 'heroku-autoscale'

and configure your Heroku credentials and the minimum and maximum numbers of dynos for your app in your rackup file

    use Heroku::Autoscale,
      :username  => ENV["HEROKU_USERNAME"],
      :password  => ENV["HEROKU_PASSWORD"],
      :app_name  => ENV["HEROKU_APP_NAME"],
      :min_dynos => 2,
      :max_dynos => 5,
      :queue_wait_low  => 100,  # milliseconds
      :queue_wait_high => 5000, # milliseconds
      :min_frequency   => 10    # seconds

Now your app will scale up with traffic and down as traffic wanes.

#### [fugitive.vim](http://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)

A nice Git wrapper for Vim:

> View any blob, tree, commit, or tag in the repository with `:Gedit` (and
`:Gsplit`, `:Gvsplit`, `:Gtabedit`, ...).  Edit a file in the index and
write to it to stage the changes.  Use `:Gdiff` to bring up the staged
version of the file side by side with the working tree version and use
Vim's diff handling capabilities to stage a subset of the file's
changes.
