# Mongrations - migrations for MongoMapper

Why would a schema-less database need migrations? Simple: to help you keep old data fresh as you change your data format. Recently added new columns to your MongoMapper model and need to update old values in your MongoDB collection?  [Terry Heath](http://terrbear.org) gives you [Mongrations](http://github.com/terrbear/mongrations):

    script/generate mongration update_followers_count_for_existing

You'll get a new file with the familiar Rails migration format:

    class UpdateFollowersCountForExisting < MongoMapper::Mongration
      def self.up
      end
 
      def self.down
      end
    end

Just add your own code to manipulate your data and call `rake db:mongrate`. Mongrations include rake tasks for `db:mongrate:redo`, `db:mongrate:up`, `db:mongrate:down`, `db:mongrate:rollback`.
