# WebFinger libraries emerge

Less than 24 hours after [Google broke the news](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_enables_webfinger_for_google_profiles_email_as_identity.php) of its take on [WebFinger](http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/), its 21st century take on the Unix [`finger`](http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/finger/) command, enterprising developers are releasing native libraries for the service.

In case you missed it, WebFinger is a way to get profile information for a user of a service based solely on their email address.

#### Ruby wrapper

[Michael Bleigh](http://twitter.com/mbleigh) at Intridea released [Redfinger](http://github.com/intridea/redfinger) as a Ruby gem:

    sudo gem install redfinger

You can then finger someone from the console:

    finger = Redfinger.finger('youraccount@gmail.com')
    finger.open_id.first.to_s # => "http://www.google.com/profiles/youraccount"

#### Python library

[Jeremy Carbaugh](http://github.com/jcarbaugh) from Sunlight Labs (you did listen to [Episode 0.1.3](http://thechangelog.com/post/382418778/episode-0-1-3-civic-hacking-with-luigi-montanez-and-jere), didn't you?) released his own [Python take](http://github.com/jcarbaugh/python-webfinger).

Spotted other WebFinger libraries in the wild? [Let us know!](http://twitter.com/changelogshow) Bonus points for one named [Goldfinger](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058150/).
