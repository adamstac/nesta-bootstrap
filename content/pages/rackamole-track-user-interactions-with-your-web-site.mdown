# Rackamole: Track user interactions with your web site

Rackamole is a rack application that tracks user's interactions with your web site. This is not about page hits. Rackamole captures the very essence of a user's activity by recording various elements of a request that occurs within your application.

Using Rackamole you are able to see which feature is a hit or a bust. As an added bonus, you can also track performance and exceptions that might have escaped your test suites or alpha env.
