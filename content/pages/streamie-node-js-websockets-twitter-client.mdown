# streamie: Node.js + Websockets = Real time Twitter client

As new technologies are delivering on the promise of the [Real Time Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_web), it's becoming apparent that the revolution will be *streamed*. [Malte Ubl](http://github.com/cramforce) seems to agree, creating [Streamie](http://github.com/cramforce/streamie), your very own real-time Twitter stream powered by [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and Websockets.

We [talked about](http://lg.gd/020) how crazy fast Node.js can be in [Episode 0.2.0](http://lg.gd/020). In [Episode 0.3.1](http://lg.gd/031), we talked about the possibilities of pushing updates to the browser with Websockets. In Streamie, the new [Twitter User Stream API](http://dev.twitter.com/pages/user_streams) provides the payload to stream your tweets to you in real time.

Websockets are implemented in Streamie using [Socket.io](http://thechangelog.com/post/456659159/socket-io-multi-transport-socket-server-for-node-js), which falls back to traditional polling in older browsers.

#### Features

Although it's still in early, active development, Streamie does offer some nice features you'd expect in a Twitter client including:

* Scroll state memory - Streamie remembers your scroll position between visits. New tweets appear scrolled offscreen to the top.
* [Google Chrome notifications](http://blog.chromium.org/2010/05/desktop-notifications-now-available-to.html) - [Growl](http://growl.info/)-like notifications for new updates.

Instructions on setting up Streamie to run locally can be found in the [README](http://github.com/cramforce/streamie#readme)
