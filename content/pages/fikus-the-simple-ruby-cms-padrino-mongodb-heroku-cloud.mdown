# fikus: Cloud-friendly Ruby CMS powered by Padrino and MongoDB

For the developer, a blog or CMS is like a favorite t-shirt. It doesn't have to be fashionable, but it's got to fit. It's in that spirit that we highlight [Fikus](http://github.com/bratta/fikus), the new simple Ruby CMS from [Tim Gourley](http://github.com/bratta).

What makes Fikus special?

* **Powered by Padrino.** [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com)'s cool Italian cousin provides a built-in admin panel. Checkout out [Episode 0.2.7](http://thechangelog.com/post/708173099/episode-0-2-7-padrino-ruby-web-framework) for more on this cool Ruby web framework.
* **MongoDB.** Document-oriented databases are great CMS databases, as we discussed in [Episode 0.0.7](http://thechangelog.com/post/287597162/episode-0-0-7-mike-dirolf-from-10gen-and-mongodb)
* **HAML-based layouts.** Never hunt down a closing `</div>` again.
* **Cloud friendly.** Fikus is ready for [Engine Yard AppCloud](http://www.engineyard.com/products/appcloud) and [Heroku](http://heroku.com) out of the box. 

Fikus is also chock full of caching optimizations and Rack middleware, or [go add your own](http://coderack.org).
