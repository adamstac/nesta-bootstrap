# HotCocoa: MacRuby HotCocoa UI library

HotCocoa is a thin & idiomatic Ruby layer that sits above Cocoa and other frameworks, developed by [Rich Kilmer](http://twitter.com/rich_Kilmer). [MacRuby](http://twitter.com/macruby) 0.5, which was recently rev'd, now supports HotCocoa.

> HotCocoa used to be developed inside the MacRuby project, but we decided that it would have a better life on GitHub, where it is far easier for developers to submit contributions...

HotCocoa also has been transformed as a gem and is included in the 0.5 package installer. Be sure to require rubygems before using it.

To see more information on HotCocoa (including tutorial) see [macruby.org](http://macruby.org/).

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'hotcocoa'
    include HotCocoa
    application do |app|
      win = window :size => [100,50]
      b = button :title => 'Hello'
      b.on_action { puts 'World!' }
      win << b
    end

####Installation

    sudo macgem install hotcocoa

(Please note 'macgem' instead of 'gem')
