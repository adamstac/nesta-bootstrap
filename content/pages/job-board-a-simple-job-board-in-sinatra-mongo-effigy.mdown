# job-board: A simple job board in Sinatra/Mongo/Effigy

No readme on this one and the details are in the short description...BUT you know we love [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) AND [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). I have (^AS) high hopes for this.

If you get a chance to pull the code and take a peek leave a comment on what you think!
