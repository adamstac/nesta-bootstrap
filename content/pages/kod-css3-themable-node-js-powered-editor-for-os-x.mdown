# kod: CSS3 themable, Node.js powered editor for OS X

It's a very Merry Christmas for Mac developers. [Rasmus Andersson](http://github.com/rsms) has open sourced [Kod](http://kodapp.com), the "programmers' editor for OS X."

Built from the ground to feel like a native OS X app, Kod sports Chrome-style tear-off tabs and aims for full concurrency, taking advantage of additional CPU cores when loading files, performing syntax highlighting, and other intensive tasks.

Even with the provided integrated scripting environment powered by [Node.js](http://thechangelog.com/search/node), perhaps the most impressive feature for the web geek is that Kod is fully themable using CSS3.

So if you're still waiting on TextMate 2.0 and Vim or emacs isn't your bag, then give Kod a try.
