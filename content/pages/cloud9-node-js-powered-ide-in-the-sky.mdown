# Cloud9: Node.js-powered IDE in the Sky

The [Ajax.org Team](http://www.ajax.org/) has finally unveiled [Cloud9](http://www.cloud9ide.com/), their much anticpated IDE-in-the-sky. Cloud9 runs on a stack of Node.js, HTML5, and their own Ajax.org frameworks which [Ruben](http://twitter.com/javruben) and [Rik](http://twitter.com/rikarends) discussed in [Episode 0.1.6](http://lg.gd/016).

#### Features

Although an early alpha, Cloud9 looks polished and includes a number of cool features:

>* Easy hackability for Javascript developers
* At least as good as existing IDE's and text editors with help from the latest browsers
* Local and remote file and repository integration
* Debugging support for Chrome / NodeJS
* Test and deploy your code in the cloud

To kick the tires yourself, you'll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed. You can then clone the [repo](http://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9) and run the install script for your version:

    $ bin/cloud9-osx64
    $ bin/cloud9-lin32
    > bin\cloud9-win32.bat
    
On the Mac, the script automatically starts the server and opens Cloud9 at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
