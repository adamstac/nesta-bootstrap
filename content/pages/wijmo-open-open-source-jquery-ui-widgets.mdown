# Wijmo Open - Open Source jQuery UI Widgets

Thanks to [Chris Bannon](http://twitter.com/b4nn0n) for [letting us know](http://twitter.com/b4nn0n/status/28752654855) about [Wijmo](http://twitter.com/wijmo).

Wijmo Open is a complete kit of jQuery UI widgets. Wijmo is an extension to jQuery UI and adds new widgets and features to your arsenal. Every widget was built to jQuery UI's standards and framework. Some widgets like slider and dialog literally extend their counterpart from jQuery UI. Each widget is ThemeRoller-ready and comes styled with our own theme called Aristo.

By the looks of things, this project was [just Open Sourced this past week](http://twitter.com/wijmo/status/27957119141) (October 20th, 2010). Documentation is still pending (maybe this Friday), but they have [a nice little demo](http://wijmo.com/Wijmo-Open/samples/) for you to check out. Also be sure to check out the `samples` directory of the project for usage details.
