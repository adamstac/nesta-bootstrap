h1. Using Textile

Textile provides a simple way of converting plain text to HTML. While similar to Markdown, the syntax is slightly closer to HTML, and allows you a bit more control over the HTML output. Inline HTML is supported.

To create a page with Textile, make a new file with a <code>.textile</code> extension inside the <code>content/pages</code> folder. See <code>content-demo/pages/examples/using-textile.textile</code> for an example.

The "Textile project page":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ gives more details on Textile's syntax.
