# Using Markdown

Markdown provides a simple way to write your copy in extremely legible plain text. The text can then be converted (by Nesta) to standards compliant HTML. Inline HTML is supported.

To create a page in Markdown, make a new file with a `.mdown` extension inside the `content/pages` folder. See `content-demo/pages/examples/using-markdown.mdown` (this page) for an example.

See my [Markdown cheat sheet](http://effectif.com/nesta/markdown-cheat-sheet) or the [Markdown project page](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Daring Fireball: Markdown") for instructions on Markdown itself.
