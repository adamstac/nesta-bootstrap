# Editing the menu

Menus are optional; not all themes will necessarily use a menu, and you don't have to fill it in if you don't want to. Having said that, if you do, you'll need to know what to do.

## The file format

Open the `content-demo/menu.txt` file and compare what you can see to the menu that's visible in the browser.

You'll notice that each line in the file refers to the path to one of the files in the `pages` directory, with the file extension removed. You'll also notice that a menu item can have nested menu items beneath it, and that each sub level is indented by two spaces.

So you could have a `menu.txt` file that looked like this:

    blog
    docs
      marking-up-pages
        examples/using-markdown
        examples/using-textile
        examples/using-haml
        adding-attachments
      menu-editing
      publishing-a-feed
    support
      faq
      knowledge-base
    about
    signup

## What gets displayed?

The entire menu doesn't necessarily have to be displayed on the page at once. Nesta's `Menu` class has methods for displaying just parts of the menu tree; you'll be able to choose which menu items are displayed on each page (or even display more than one menu, each generated from the same tree).

However, this isn't the right place for me to elaborate on how to use the `Menu` class; the goal of this page is simply to get you started with `menu.txt`. Jog on!
